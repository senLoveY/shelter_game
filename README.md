It is my first big project on Python.

To play a game you should start "main.py". After you enter the number of players(it can be from 6 to 16 to work correctly, bur you can change it in file). Then press big button. 

You will get 2 folder(text files with roles for each player will be in the folder "players", and pictures will be in the folder "player_cards").

So, you should sent cards or text files to your friends and play! Have fun!


P.S. In future I will update my project. If you have an idea, how I can do it, please, contact with me.
